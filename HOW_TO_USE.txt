Whats is DPSA?
--------------

DPSA is a BASH code aimed on automating some of routine tasks in data processing and
Source analysis using KIWI tools and PYROCKO package. 
There is no need of significant pre-processes to use this code. All you need to do is  
To install the following Packages:


REQUIREMENTS
------------

1) KIWI (Kinematic Waveform Inversion)
-Main page:
http://kinherd.org/
-Github page: 
https://github.com/emolch/kiwi

2) Pyrocko
-Installation page:
https://pyrocko.org/v0.3/install/index.html

3) SAC (Seismic Analysis Code)
-Download page:
https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/software/downloads/sac/

4) GMT (Version 5.x)

5) Zenity (wrote on version 3.22.0)
-Github page:
https://github.com/GNOME/zenity



USAGE TIPS
-----------
***~~Before doing anything, Modify lines 17-21 of DPSA code and set the proper paths~~***
***~~ Use the st_st_dis/st_st_dist bash code to calculate station-station distances. Put 
the output in $DPSA/HOME directory and hide it (.sta_sta_dist.txt).
We'll need this file in station distribution smoothness procedure.


1) Data Query -------1-1) Seismic Data Acquisition
              -------1-2) GCMT Catalog Search
              -------1-3) GFZ Catalog Search

1-1) Seismic Data Acquisition
-Download seismic data from different well-known networks. (using rapidown utility)
-In the current version its limited to 'GFZ','IRIS' and 'Orfeus' networks.
-Results will be stored in DATA_QUERY dir.

1-2) GCMT Catalog Search
-Search through GCMT events. Result will be stored in EVE_SEARCH dir.

1-3) GFZ Catalog Search
-Search through GFZ events. Result will be stored in EVE_SEARCH dir.



2) Data Processing --------2-1) Process a set of raw data            
                   --------2-2) Shift a set of mseed data
                   --------2-3) Merge a Set of sac data
                   --------2-4) Open event info file
                   --------2-5) Open event log file


2-1) Process a set of raw data            
-Check your config file before start processing.
-Your raw data must be availabe in INPUT dir.
-Once you import the event info, It will be saved in a file named .ev_info for future processes.

2-2) Shift a set of mseed data
-Using this section, It would be possible to apply a negative/positive time shift to all mseed
data located in the SHIFT_DATA/ directory.

2-3) Merge a Set of sac data
-If you have some data need to be merged, Put them in the INPUT directory and run this section. 
-Merged data will be stored in $MERGE/$NAME directory.

2-4) Open The Event Info File
-Here is where you can check your pre-imported event information.

2-5) Open The Event Log File
-During every data processing, Some useful information will be printed to a text file named 
.log_file. You can check it out here.


3) Quick Source Study 

-Check the config file before proceeding (KIWI Configs section).
-Here we are using the KIWI tools to perfom an semi-automated source analysis.
-The ".ev.info" file will be used to complete the origin time and location parameters.
-This sectioin only tested in IRAN region.


4) Pyrocko Toolbox    ---------4-1) Build Synthetic Data
                      ---------4-2) Plot FS Piercing Points
                      ---------4-3) Plot Hudson Diagram
                      ---------4-4) Convert S_D_R to MT
                      ---------4-5) Convert MT to S_D_R
                      ---------4-6) Convert Mag to M0
                      ---------4-7) Azimuthal Gap Info


4-1) Build Synthetic Data
-Before start using this feature, copy the SYNTHETIC/example.stations.info file to stations.info
and set your stations coordinates.


4-2) Plot FS Piercing Points
-Plot a focal sphere diagram including markers at positions of P/p/S/s wave ray piercing points.
-The only thing you need to proceed this section is a velocity model in the PLOT/ST_2_FOCAL/ dir.


4-3) Plot Hudson Diagram
-Plot Hudson diagram.


4-4) Convert S_D_R to MT
-Simply convert a fault plain parameters (strike-dip-rake) to moment tensor.


4-5) Convert MT to S_D_R
-Reverse case of section 3-6.

4-6) Convert Mag to M0
-Convert moment magnitude to scalar moment.

4-7) Azimuthal Gap Info
-Calculate first and second azimuthal gap.
-It uses KIWI output files to process.
