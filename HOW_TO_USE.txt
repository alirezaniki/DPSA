USAGE TIPS
-----------
***~~Before doing anything, Modify lines 17-21 of DPSA code and set the proper paths~~***


1) Data Query -------1-1) Data Acquisition
              -------1-2) GCMT Catalog Search
              -------1-3) GFZ Catalog Search

1-1) Data Acquisition
-Download seismic data from different well-known networks. (using rapidown utility)
-In the current version its limited to 'GFZ' and 'IRIS' networks.
-Results will be stored in DATA_QUERY dir.

1-2) GCMT Catalog Search
-Search through GCMT events. Result will be stored in EVE_SEARCH dir.

1-3) GFZ Catalog Search
-Search through GFZ events. Result will be stored in EVE_SEARCH dir.



2) Data Processing --------2-1) Process Using a new Event Info              
                   --------2-2) Process Using The Prior Event Info
                   --------2-3) Merge a Set of SAC Data
                   --------2-4) Shift a Set of Mseed Data
                   --------2-5) Open The Event Info File
                   --------2-6) Open The Event Log File


2-1) Process Using a new Event Info
-Check your config file before start processing.
-Use this section only if you are about to process some data from a new event.
-Your raw data must be availabe in INPUT dir.
-Once you import the event info, It will be saved in a file named .ev_info.

2-2) Process Using The Prior Event Info
-Process some data using the info stored in .ev_info file.

2-3) Merge a Set of SAC Data
-If you have some data need to be merged, Put them in the INPUT directory and run this section. 
-Merged data will be stored in $MERGE/$NAME directory.

2-4) Shift a Set of Mseed Data
-Using this section, It would be possible to apply a negative/positive time shift to all mseed
data located in the SHIFT_DATA/ directory.

2-5) Open The Event Info File
-Here is where you can check your pre-imported event information.

2-6) Open The Event Log File
-During every data processing, Some useful information will be printed to a text file named 
.log_file. You can check it out here.


3) Quick Source Study ---------3-1) Automated Source Analysis
                      ---------3-2) Build Synthetic Data
                      ---------3-3) Plot Hudson Diagram
                      ---------3-4) Plot Piercing Points
                      ---------3-5) Plot a STA-EVE Map
                      ---------3-6) Convert S_D_R to MT
                      ---------3-7) Convert MT to S_D_R
                      ---------3-8) Convert Mag to M0
                      ---------3-9) Azimuthal Gap Info


3-1) Automated Source Analysis
-Check the config file before proceeding (KIWI Configs section).
-Here we are using the KIWI tools to perfom an automated source analysis.
-The ".ev.info" file will be used to complete the origin time and location parameters.
-This sectioin only tested in IRAN region.


3-2) Build Synthetic Data
-Before start using this feature, copy the SYNTHETIC/example.stations.info file to stations.info
and set your stations coordinates.

3-3) Plot Hudson Diagram
-Plot Hudson diagram using the pyrocko package.

3-4) Plot Piercing Points
-Plot a focal sphere diagram including markers at positions of P/p/S/s wave ray piercing points.
-The only thing you need to proceed this section is a velocity model in the PLOT/ST_2_FOCAL/ dir.

3-5) Plot a STA-EVE Map
-Draw a quick and dirty Map, including stations and the event location.
-What you need before proceeding this step is header-filled SAC data in the INPUT directory.
-These data must be available if you have processed your data before (using section 2-1/2-2).

3-6) Convert S_D_R to MT
-Simply convert a fault plain parameters (strike-dip-rake) to moment tensor.

3-7) Convert MT to S_D_R
-Reverse case of section 3-6.

3-8) Convert Mag to M0
-Convert moment magnitude to scalar moment.

3-9) Azimuthal Gap Info
-Calculate first and second azimuthal gap.
-It uses header filled SAC data in INPUT dir.
